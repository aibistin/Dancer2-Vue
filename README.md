# Dancer2-Vue-Webpack
### Perl Dancer2 Web framework with Vue.js and Webpack
##### This is a Perl version of [Laracasts, Learn Vue 2: Step by Step tutorial](https://laracasts.com/)

The Laracasts tutorial is an excellent Vue.js tutorial, much of which is built around the Laravel PHP web framework.
I figured that rather than learning PHP, I could customize this to work with Perl's [Dancer2 web framework](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2).

This setup is my workaround for [Episode 22, "Webpack Config From Scratch"](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/episodes/22)

#### Getting Started

Presuming you have both NPM and Node.js installed,

* Clone this repository
* `cd ./js` 
* `npm install`
 
* `npm run dev` or  `npm run webpack` or  `npm run production`

* `cd ..`

* `plackup bin\app.psgi`

* Follow the tutorial
