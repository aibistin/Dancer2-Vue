# Dancer2-Vue
### Perl Dancer2 Web framework with Vue.JS
##### This is based on the the [Laracasts, Learn Vue 2: Step by Step tutorial](https://laracasts.com/)

The Laracasts tutorial is an excellent Vue.JS tutorial, but unfortunately for me, much of it is based around the Laravel PHP web framework. 
I just adapted it a little to work with Perl's Dancer2 Web framework. 

#### Presuming you have both npm and node installed
`cd ./js` 
`npm install`
